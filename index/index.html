      <p>Everything in life is a trade-off. Some of us are born with high aptitudes for academic 
learning, some are born with great physical skills, some are athletic, some are artistic and so 
on.</p>
      
      <p>In terms of skills and talents, humans are wildly diversified. What we end up 
accomplishing in life ultimately depends on our practice and effort, but we are all born with 
different aptitudes and potentials</p>
